# Dynamize.js
Dynamize your website: small plain vanilla javascript goodies for enhancing user interaction (it is not yet another javascript framework)

There is a lot of functionality already considered in HTML5 + CSS3 that works out-of-the-box in all the main browsers nowadays. A web developer should consider javascript as the last-resort solution.
That's where Dynamize starts to be useful. The idea is not to have another javascript framework. Instead, Dynamize is designed to play nice with most of the popular frameworks: Vue, React, Angular to name a few.
Dynamize is a loose collection of small, independient, plain vanilla javascript files to do one specific task and designed to avoid messing with the existing site layout.

In other words, just grab or link the file you want to use, drop it in your existing website project and there is a good chance that everything is going to work as expected regardless of the nature of the project, even when using a framework. 

Currently, the collection is composed by:

* [scrolling.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/scrolling.html)
* [moving.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/all.html)
* [rotating.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/all.html)
* [sizing.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/all.html)
* [sliding.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/sliding.html)
* [couching.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/couching.html)
* [filtering.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/filtering.html)
* [multipane.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/multipane.html)
* [gantting.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/gantting.html)
* [editing.js](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize/examples/editing.html)

The names are self explanatory, however, there are example files for each one.

The scope of Couching is to provide a permanent storage for changes taking advantage of the flexibility offered by CouchDB compatible databases.
