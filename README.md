# adjust.js
Small plain vanilla javascript goodies for enhancing user interaction

When enhancing a website for eye-candy and user interaction, there is nothing better than a pure CSS + HTML solution. When such a solution is not available, the developer needs to resort to javascript. That is the origin of adjust.js: a loose collection of small, independient, plain vanilla javascript files to do one specific task and designed to avoid messing with the existing site layout.

In other words, just grab the file you want, drop it in your existing website project and there is a good chance that everything is going to work as expected regardless of the nature of the project, even when external frameworks are used. 

Currently, the collection is composed by:

* [scrolling.js](http://j-pel.github.com/scrolling.html)
* [moving.js](http://j-pel.github.com/moving.html)
* [rotating.js](http://j-pel.github.com/rotating.html)
* [sizing.js](http://j-pel.github.com/sizing.html)

The names are self explanatory, however, there are example files for each one.

They were tested and are known to work well on:
* Firefox (Windows, Linux, Android)
* Chrome (Windows, Linux, Android)
* Safari (iOS)
* Opera (Android)
* IE 9+ (Windows)
