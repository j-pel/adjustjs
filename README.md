Small vanilla javascript goodies for enhancing user interaction

When enhancing a website for eye-candy and user interaction, nothing better than a pure CSS + HTML solution.
In those cases where such a solution is not available, the developer needs to resort to javascript. This is the origin of adjust.js. It's a collection of small vanilla javascript files with no external dependencies that are not going to mess with the existing site layout.

In other words, just grab the file you want and it will work well on your existing project. It is going to work well with any framework or with no framework at all. 

Currently, the collection is composed by:

* [scrolling.js](scrolling.html)
* [moving.js](moving.html)
* [rotating.js](rotating.html)
* [sizing.js](sizing.html)

The names are self explanatory, however, there are example files for each one.

They were tested and are known to work well on:
* Firefox (Windows, Linux, Android)
* Chrome (Windows, Linux, Android)
* Safari (iOS)
* Opera (Android)
* IE 9+ (Windows)
