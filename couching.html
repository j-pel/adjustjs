    <h1>couching.js</h1>
    <p>Couching is a very small wrapper around Apache CouchDB REST API. CouchDB comes with its own couch.js, a simple AJAX wrapper with a caveat: is implemented with synchronous calls. That was the driving force behind couching.js project: A small, asynchronous wrapper built around ES6 Promises while preserving the simplicity and elegance of the CouchDB API.</p>
    <p>CouchDB is reliable, easy to use, flexible and fast. There are also several database service providers that let you run CouchDB instances for free. That's a lot of power to drive your own cloud.</p>
    <p>Couching is useful as a generic document store, as a solid user authentication mechanism or as originally conceived, to persist the user interactions originated by the other Dynamize.js tools.</p>
    <p>The database could be located on any server such as IrisCouch, Cloudant or on a local running instance of CouchDB.</p>
    <p>Couch databases are stores for freeform JSON documents. Just create a database and start feeding documents into it. To retrieve a particular document, use the document id. To retrieve several related documents, a view should be created as a javascript map function iterating through all documents in the database.</p>
    <p>In order to use it for persisting the kind of interactions derived from Dynamize, just create a database and store a document for each UI element. Then update the document each time the element changes, by means of the store function on each tool.</p>
