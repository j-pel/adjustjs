This is the origin of adjust.js. It's a collection of small vanilla javascript files with no external dependencies that are not going to mess with the existing site layout.\r\n\r\nIn other words, just grab the file you want and it will work well on your existing project. It is going to work well with any framework or with no framework at all. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the collection is composed by:\r\n\r\n* [scrolling.js](scrolling.html)\r\n* [moving.js](moving.html)\r\n* [rotating.js](rotating.html)\r\n* [sizing.js](sizing.html)\r\n\r\nThe names are self explanatory, however, there are example files for each one.\r\n\r\nThey were tested and are known to work well on:\r\n* Firefox (Windows, Linux, Android)\r\n* Chrome (Windows, Linux, Android)\r\n* Safari (iOS)\r\n* Opera (Android)\r\n* IE 9+ (Windows)\r\n\r\n",
